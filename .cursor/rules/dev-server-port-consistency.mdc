# Dev Server Port Consistency

- When starting or restarting local dev servers, use the project's standard ports instead of spinning up alternates.
- For frontend Vite, always start on port `5173` with strict port binding (for example, `--port 5173 --strictPort`).
- If port conflicts exist, stop old dev server processes first, then start a single server on the standard port.
- Avoid leaving multiple frontend dev servers running on `5173`, `5174`, `5175`, etc. Keep one active instance on the canonical port.
